"""Functional tests for CLI
"""

# Alice has heard about a new cool file server app.
# She downloaded the package from its homepage into a local directory.
# Since Alice is an experienced user she immediately runs the main module from CLI.

# Alice notices an error message about some required arguments.

# To understand what arguments the main module gets she runs the main module with "-h" argument.

# Now Alice knows that she must provide in CLI a location of the data directory.
# She starts the app with a required argument "-d" and sees that now app starts without errors.

# Alice is also a very curious person. She wants to try an alternative argument for specifying data directory.
# She stops the app. And starts it again using "--data-directory" to specify the data directory.

# Again, Alice sees that the app starts without errors.

# Satisfied Alice stops the app and takes a coffee-break.
